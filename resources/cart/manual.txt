Void Merchants

Manual for v9.0.5

Void Merchants is a Space Invaders-inspired roguelike action game built in PICO-8.
Blast enemies, collect resources and trade your way to upgrades
as you progress through increasingly difficult space battles!

Controls

↑ ↓ ← → : Move your ship and cursor while trading
X, V : Shoot (Can be held down)
Y, C : Interact (talk to NPCs or perform trades)
Create save games at each visit to the trader by hitting X or V
Load them again at the title screen by hitting Y or C

Can also be played with a controller! Tested with an Xbox controller - others may work too.

The buttons shown on screen are meant for the Playstation controller layout,
meaning that the X-button in-game is actually not the X-button on a Xbox controller. 

The controls can be adjusted in the PICO-8 settings (pause button located next to the bottom-right corner).

                             This only applies to the shots from your ship

- Buy attack / cargo drone - Buy additional or larger drones
- Rebuild drones to attack / cargo - Change your drone type**

*If you cannot equip any upgrades anymore that are dropped by enemies,
you can keep them for now and install them later when your ship was upgraded.
Or you can just sell them for credits!

**Beware when changing your drone type.
Changing from attack to cargo will remove all but one of the drones' weapons, which will then be permanently lost.
Even when converting back to an attack drone.
