Play the web version now! [Void Merchants](https://scatenix.github.io/Void-Merchants/)

## Controls

- ↑ ↓ ← → : Move your ship and cursor while trading
- X, V : Shoot (Can be held down)
- Y, C : Interact (talk to NPCs or perform trades)
- Create save games at each visit to the trader by hitting X or V
- Load them again at the title screen by hitting Y or C

Can also be played with a controller! Tested with an Xbox controller - others may work too.

The buttons shown on screen are meant for the Playstation controller layout,
meaning that the X-button in-game is actually not the X-button on a Xbox controller. 

The controls can be adjusted in the PICO-8 settings (pause button located next to the bottom-right corner).

Make sure to check the manual for more information about the game. Can be found on the release section!

## State of the Game

The game is currently in the balancing and testing phase.

All planned features have been implemented, except for a final boss fight, which was not possible, due to a code length restriction from PICO-8.

The game offers:
- A title screen with the possibility to load the last save
- Space fights from level 1 to 20
- Trading
- Upgrading the player ship and drone
- Collecting resources, dropped from the enemy ships
- Travel cutscenes between the battles
- Saving, which can be done whilst trading
- Brief conversations with the trader and a mysterious being

## Tech Stack

- Lua (PICO-8 dialect)
- The PICO-8 fantasy console
- Bash

## What is PICO-8?

PICO-8 is a fantasy console made by Lexaloffle Games for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs.

The hardware is intentionally very limited - it only has 2 MiB of RAM.

You can read more about it on the official FAQ: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=faq.

## Structure

- `root` directory - Contains the actual playable cartridge file `void-merchants.p8` as well as scripts to split and merge this cartridge.
- `game` - Contains individual PICO-8 code files for easier readability. Generated by the `split.sh` script and can be merged back to a playable cartridge with the `merge.sh` script.
- `docs` - Contains an exported version of the game to HTML and JavaScript to be played without the actual PICO-8 console. This is an official feature of PICO-8.

## Running the Game

Play the web version - [Void Merchants](https://scatenix.github.io/Void-Merchants/)

Note: The default sound volume can be a bit loud. I recommend lowering your browser's volume before starting.

The sound volume can be adjusted in the settings (pause button next to the bottom-right corner).

Or play it directly on the PICO-8 fantasy console by downloading this png and loading it into PICO-8:

<img src="https://github.com/Scatenix/Void-Merchants/blob/main/resources/cart/void-merchants.p8.png" alt="Void Merchants Game Cartridge" />

How to do this:
- Either open PICO-8 and drag and drop `void-merchants.p8.png` into the window (Alt+Enter to toggle fullscreen)
    - (Windows only) Or drag and drop `void-merchants.p8.png` onto the PICO-8.exe
- To save it permanently into your carts, type `save void-merchants`
    - To play the game later again, type `load void-merchants`
- To start the game, type `run` or hit ctrl+r

The game is not yet on the official splore game explorer.

## About the Performance

Because PICO-8 is using a virtualized CPU that is running at about 8 MHz, the game should run on pretty much every system.

- No more than 300 KiB RAM is being used in all scenarios I have tested
- For 20 enemies at level 20 (highest level) on one screen: rarely more than 0.3 CPUs of the virtualized PICO-8 Processor (a score of > 1.0 = game slowdown)
    - One wave can have a maximum of 9 enemies spawned at a time. A second wave will be spawned after some time. No more than 2 waves at the same time are possible
- All off-screen elements are mostly deleted or at least deactivated to avoid heavy calculations or useless rendering
    - Exception: Enemies that spawn behind other enemies will be fully calculated and rendered as an arrow at the right screen edge

Currently only less than 10 of 8192 tokens are left for the game code. There shouldn't really be any unused code, since I had to make sure there is nothing unnecessary to stay in this limit. This even includes comments.

## How to create a new Release

The majority of the release is being done on the local development environment through a bash script `release_void-merchants.sh`.
This approach was chosen to avoid having to include some of the unusual needed apps in a docker image for the release process.
Especially because of PICO-8 which I am not allowed to distribute.

The GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) only copies the release artifacts to the new release within the GitHub repository.

Pushing to main will automatically trigger a deploy of the contents in `docs/` to the repositories GitHub Pages site.
This is meant to contain the game as .html and .js, exported by PICO-8.

### Prerequisites

Following apps are needed for `release_void-merchants.sh`:

- Common Unix utilities
    - bash
    - sed
- PICO-8
- Git
- Libre Office
- 7-Zip

### Adjust the Release Script for your development Environment

3 variables need to be set within the script `release_void-merchants.sh`. This is done to avoid needing to have these apps in the PATH.

PICO8_EXE="/path/to/pico8.exe"
_7Z_EXE="/path/to/7z.exe"
LIBRE_OFFICE_EXE="/path/to/soffice.exe"

### Prepare the Release

- Make sure every change for the new release is commited, including the text in `Release-Text` that is used for the Release section on the GitHub repository.
- Adjust the new version number in the `VERSION` file in the project root. Else the release will fail.

### Release

- Execute the scripe `release_void-merchants.sh`
    - This will take a few seconds to generate all release artifacts
- You will be asked to check if everything is fine before committing and tagging the release
    - Use a git diff view. A handful of things will be automatically adjusted, like the version number accross different files
    - Cancel with n (no)
    - Confirm with y (yes)

The script will then automatically push the new version tag and to main and trigger the GitHub Actions.

## Known Bugs

- Major: Game balancing needs to be tested!
- ? Major: Game save should be destroyed after loading to avoid loading the game over and over again
    - And saving should quit to title screen. Else this isn't a true roguelike
    - I might leave it like this, just to make it easier and let the player decide
- Minor: Down-scaled planets look terrible
    - I don't think this is possible without overly complex solutions
- Minor: Sounds or music sometimes skips
    - Unavoidable at the moment because of only 4 sound channels. Game design would need to improve here
