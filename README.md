Create save-games at each visit to the trader by hitting X/V.

Load them at the title screen by hitting Y/C.

# State of the Game

The game is still in development.

However, it is already in a playable state and the intended game loop is already completely implemented.

Major parts that are missing:
- Balancing is far from enjoyable at the moment (it gets very hard very quickly)
- Explanations of the controls and abbreviations
- Bug fixing

# Tech Stack

- Lua (PICO-8 dialect)
- The PICO-8 fantasy console
- Bash (For splitting and merging the cartridge files for easier development and readability)

# What is PICO-8?

PICO-8 is a fantasy console made by Lexaloffle Games for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs.

The hardware is intentionally very limited - it only has 2 MiB of RAM.

You can read more about it on the official FAQ: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=faq.

# Structure

- `root` directory - Contains the actual playable cartridge file `void_merchants.p8` as well as scripts to split and merge this cartridge.
- `game` - Contains individual PICO-8 code files for easier readability. They are generated by the `split.sh` script and can be merged back to a playable cartridge with the `merge.sh` script
- `docs` - Contains an exported version of the game to HTML and JavaScript to be played without the actual PICO-8 console. This is an official feature of PICO-8

# Running the Game

Play the web version - [Void Merchants](https://scatenix.github.io/Void-Merchants/)

Note: The default sound volume can be a bit loud. I recommend lowering your browser's volume before starting.

Controls:
- ↑ ↓ ← → : Move your ship
- C       : Shoot (Can be held down)
- V       : Advance text / dialog

Can also be played with a controller! Tested with an Xbox controller - others may work too.

Both the sound volume and the controls can be adjusted in the settings (Pause button next to the bottom right corner).

---

Or play it directly on the PICO-8 fantasy console.

The game is not yet on the official `splore` game explorer.

Take the following steps for Windows:
- Copy the `void_merchants.p8` file to `%AppData%\pico-8\carts\`
- Open PICO-8 and type `load void_merchants.p8`
- Type `run` or hit ctrl+r

# About the Performance

- No more than 300 KiB RAM is being used in all scenarios I have tested
- For 20 enemies at lvl 20 (highest level) on one screen: rarely more than 0.3 CPUs of the virtualized PICO-8 Processor (a score of > 1.0 = game slowdown)
    - One wave can have a maximum of 10 enemies spawned at a time. A second wave will be spawned when the current wave flew about half way through.
- All off-screen elements are mostly deleted or at least deactivated, to avoid heavy calculations or useless rendering.
    - Exception: Enemies that spawn behind other enemies will be fully calculated and rendered as an arrow at the right screen edge.

Currently only about 70 of 8192 tokens are left for the game code. There shouldn't really be any unused code, since I had to make sure there is nothing unnecessary to stay in this limit.

# Known Bugs

- Major: Game balancing needs to be tested!
- Minor: Down-scaled planets look terrible
    - I don't think this is possible in a non-overly complex way
- Minor: Sounds or music sometimes skips
    - Unavoidable at the moment because of only 4 sound channels. Game design would need to improve here

# Pending Improvements

- Explain abbreviations like wps, sts, and so on
    - Will probably not happen. I don't know where to put it. Players should just figure it out by themselves
